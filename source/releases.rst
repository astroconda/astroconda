Pipeline Releases
#################

.. note::

    - A working installation of Miniconda or Anaconda is required.
    - Python 2.x.x is not supported (unless noted otherwise).
    - 32-bit operating systems are not supported.

Pipeline releases differ from the standard software stack and serve a different purpose. The release files described below are immutable snapshots of STScI operational software, and can be used to replicate the environment used by STScI to perform mission-specific data processing. Be aware that upgrading packages with ``conda update [pkg]`` or ``conda update --all`` is not recommended as it will likely introduce unwanted bugs and/or break the environment all together.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns related to pipeline releases please feel free to contact help@stsci.edu

Installation
============

Pipeline release installations use the following ``conda create`` command format:

.. code-block:: sh

    conda create -n [custom_env_name] --file [URL]
    source activate [custom_env_name]


Example
-------

.. code-block:: sh

    conda create -n demo_2016.1 \
        --file http://ssb.stsci.edu/releases/hstdp/2016.1/hstdp-2016.1-linux-py35.0.txt
    source activate demo_2016.1

The URL shown in this example does not necessarily reflect the latest iteration available. Please consult the :ref:`files` section to ensure you are installing the correct release.

File URLs
=========

Select the URL that matches your intended platform and environment.

Continuous Integration
======================

This example BASH function provides a starting point for users intending to execute pipeline software from within a continuous integration environment. This installation method is unsupported and your mileage may vary. Use at your own risk.

.. code-block:: sh

    function get_pipeline()

    # Usage example:
    #

    # Silently generate a pipeline environment called "hst_env"
    get_pipeline hst_env hstdp 2017.2

    # Enter environment
    source activate hst_env

    # ... do work ...
