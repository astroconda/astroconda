Welcome to AstroConda's documentation!
======================================

AstroConda is a free Conda channel maintained by the `Space Telescope Science Institute <http://www.stsci.edu/>`_ (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland. This channel provides tools and utilities required to work with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, as well as data from other telescopes. Our software is compiled and tested regularly to confirm that each package will work correctly on a variety of system configurations.
